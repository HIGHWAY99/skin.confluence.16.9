[B]2.1.379 - 2014-02-21 - Changes By TheHighway[/B]
- disabled notify.wav and out.wav in "/sounds/sounds.xml".
- Testing some .xbt media themes from other skins to see how they would work on this skin.  No others really to speak of for now.
- Attempted a "/colors/testing.xml" but I really don't see any visible changes at the moment.
- Added from skin.confluence.custom.mod:  Fire & Kryptonite themes and colors.

[B]2.1.378 - 2014-02-06 - Changes By TheHighway[/B]
- 9991,9992,9993 ID's were set to the labels for handling the text in the top-left corner of screens.  This was so I could easily grab the label text(s) and see what screen it's on.
- Handling for non-default custom background images to be shown instead of the default one in as many screens as possible.  while some do use $LOCALIZE[#], others do use english text instead where needed to make things work for my personal use.  This means those using a different language might have the default background image showing up on some screens, instead.
- XBMCHUB graphic "devil is in the detail" graphic someone had made for me a while back.  I blacked out the background as well as I could and placed it in place of the settings.jpg image.  Needed a little change as the old one was nice and all but was getting a bit stale with age.
- XBMCHUB Logo replacing the XBMC Logo watermark on homescreen.
- Custom Backgrounds for: Music, Programs, Settings.
- Custom Background for Video(videos/movies/tvshows).
- That should tell ya why I named it to 16:9, besides the obvious inside joke that it's also a resolution.
- Picture, Music, Program Add-ons - Number of Shortcuts set to 9
- Video Add-ons - Number of Shortcuts set to 16
- Addon Name: "Confluence 16:9 Icons"

- Credit to Jezz_X and Team XBMC for all the work they've put into the previous reincarnations of the skin and it's various mods.
